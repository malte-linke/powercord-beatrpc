# Powercord BeatRPC
> A more detailed Beat Saber RPC

BeatRPC is a plugin for [Powercord](https://powercord.dev/) which shows more details of your current Beat Saber session using Discord Rich Presence. <br>
This way, people can see what song you're playing. <br>
I plan to add more features in the future, like showing the current song's difficulty, or the current song's bpm.

## Installation

This plugin requires you to have the [HTTP Status](https://github.com/opl-/beatsaber-http-status) mod for Beat Saber installed.
A detailed tutorial on how to install it can be found [here](https://github.com/opl-/beatsaber-http-status).

If you have the mod installed, you can install this plugin by opening your `plugins` directory and running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/malte-linke/powercord-beatrpc
```

Finally, restart Discord to fetch missing plugins.
